Management of late day requests using Google Forms and Google Sheets

== ‚öôÔ∏è Setting Up

. Create the configuration file `config/config.ts` from the sample `config/sample.ts`.
. Run the following commands:
+
[source,bash]
----
npm ci
npm run build
npm run clasp login # if not globally logged in
npm run clasp create -- --type standalone --title "Late Days Script"
npm run deploy
----
. Run `npm run clasp open` to open the on-line script editor in the browser, and execute the top-level function `init` within the opened script editor.

== ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Code Re-deployment

. Run the following commands after updating the code:
+
[source,bash]
----
npm run build
npm run deploy
----

=== ‚ôªÔ∏è Form Regenaration

If the configuration is changed, you should also regenerate the form _after_ updating the code:

. Run `npm run clasp open` to open the on-line script editor in the browser, and execute the top-level function `regenerateForm` within the script editor to regenerate the form.

== üßò Advanced Setup

It is possible to avoid `npm run clasp open` and execute top-level functions directly from the command line, but a much more advanced setup is needed. Carefully follow https://github.com/google/clasp/blob/master/docs/run.md[clasp`' documentation on `clasp run`] to enable this feature. (Caveat: it seems `executionApi.access` in `application.json` can remain to be `MYSELF` unless you want others to run the script; in other words, you do not have to modify `application.json` at all.)
