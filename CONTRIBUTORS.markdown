The idea was originally conceived by Favonia, implemented by Zhuyang Wang, further revised by Zhuyang Wang and Favonia, and then improved by Yashveer Bika. It had been used in multiple courses taught by Favonia before it was brought to the public GitHub website. The new version on the public GitHub website was rewritten by Favonia.
